Project Scope and Objectives:
Design and construct an autonomous Nutrient Analyzer for measuring chemical composition of
water samples.

1. Implement and integrate provided equipment including pump motors, valve motor,
communication board, spectrophotometer, tubing, flow cells, auxiliary pump, holding
coils, and Raspberry Pi.

a. Developed communication protocol between microcomputer and communication
board to control pumps and selector valve through communication board.
b. Establish control of the auxiliary pump and light source using GPIO pins.
c. Create a program that controls analyzer through developed assays for various
chemical assays.

i. Sequence involves synchronization of pumps, mixing two different
chemicals, as well as repeating at desired time intervals.
d. Integrate spectrophotometer for data collection
i. Connect essential hardware and program for sample prep and data
collection.

3. Create a housing for the components
a. Design and build a watertight enclosure for all components.
i. Allow for instrument to be operated in the lab and in the field.
b. Storage container for chemical bags
i. Container must be able to be flooded to reduce contamination from
oxygenation.

Project Results:
1. Successfully integrated components in splash proof enclosure.
2. Successfully designed a program for the required chemical assays
3. Designed and modified container for chemical storage.
